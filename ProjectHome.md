The goal of the project is to create a text-based version of the game of Reversi (AKA Othello) that allows a human player to play against the computer. The computer should be able to play at the level of a beginner to the game. If time permits I will try to create a stronger AI opponent, allow the user to select moves via the mouse and create a simple graphical representation of the game board.
